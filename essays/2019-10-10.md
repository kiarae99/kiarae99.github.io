## UI 

UI Frameworks... This module I had a lot of fun with. In my opinion, this module was the easiest. Sure, there are a lot of different aspects to Semantic UI; but after doing it repeatedly, it got easier. While looking at everyone's re-created websites, I was in awe. Some people went above just the basic that we needed. Lowkey, I am tempted to buy the membership to PluralSight, just to be able to watch more of the videos on Semantic UI content and learn more than what was required for the class. I am curious to see what else we can do using Semantic UI. Just finishing the recreated website, I felt good. You would think that it takes a lot more experience and knowledge to re-create websites that professional program engineers have created, but semantic UI made it a lot simpler.

## Why? ü§î

Semantic UI allowed for us to put certain things that was out of reach from using just HTML and CSS. It made the page look cleaner. Only using HTML and CSS, the pages looked boring and out of date. Recreating pages of professionally done websites always seemed hard, but with Semantic UI it was just a matter of figuring out which property to use. Semantic UI is easy, but complex to use. It took me a lot of trial and error to try and figure out which function/component to use and then how to use it to make it look like what I have in mind.
  
## üòÅüòÅ Can't wait!

I can't wait to see what else UI has to offer. Even though my interest is not in web design, I am excited to see what else we can do with UI. If I don't end up finding a job in the field I am interested in, at least I have this back up knowledge of web design.
