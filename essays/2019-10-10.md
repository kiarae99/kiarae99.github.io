## UI

UI Frameworks... This module I had a lot of fun with. In my opinion, this module was the easiest. Sure, there are a lot of different aspects to Semantic UI; but after doing it repeatedly, it got easier. While looking at everyone's re-created websites, I was in awe. Some people went above just the basic that we needed.

## Why?

Semantic UI allowed for us to put certain things that was out of reach from using just HTML and CSS. It made the page look cleaner. Only using HTML and CSS, the pages looked boring and out of date. Recreating pages of professionally done websites always seemed hard, but with Semantic UI it was just a matter of figuring out which property to use.
  
## üòÅüòÅ Can't wait!

I can't wait to see what else UI has to offer. Even though my interest is not in web design, I am excited to see what else we can do with UI.
