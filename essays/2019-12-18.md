This past semester we have learned a lot about software engineering. To get a good understanding of software
 engineering, you need to understand the smaller stuff first and then apply everything into one.
 
##Using GitHub

We have been using the Github platform for our Configuration Management portion throughout this semester. Finding a good
 program that you like to use to organize your projects is one of the first things needed in software engineering
 . Without GitHub, you can still write your code, but the perks of it is being able to see each commit to the file
 . When an error pops up, you can see the change in the program from the current one to the one before the error. 
 
 ### Groups and Programming
 One thing I really loved about using GitHub was that it was so easy to use. It made working in groups so much easier
  because we didn't need to be in the same room as each other to get things done. It also helps show who's holding up
   their end of the workload. 
 
##React

User Interface Frameworks are very important to know when doing software engineering. This allows programmers to make
 their program more appealing and organized. There are so many components that you can utilize to turn something from
  average to extraordinary. This is the 21st century, where everything is modernized. People don't want to be looking
   at something that looks like it belongs in the 1900s. 
   
I could go on and on about different aspect of software engineering because there is a lot. But for now, just stick
 to the basics and learn it one by one.
