## Work Smarter, Not Harder ðŸŽ“

ESLint is the best thing ever. It making programming way easier. One of the things that I hated the most about programming is when I come up with an error. It used to take me forever to figure out how to solve it, sometimes I would even just scratch my entire program and start fresh. ESLint just lets me know what my error is and if I dont understand what the error is, I can just look it up on Google.

## Errors aren't Fun ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘

Getting errors is not something people like. I get aggravated whenever I make an error, whether it be for school or even work. I feel like errors is just a time consuming thing. When I have a deadline, making errors are not ideal. ESLint helps alleviate some of my aggravation because I don't have to spend a whole lot of time finding the error or even starting over completely.

## Where was ESLint for ICS 111 or ICS 211? ðŸ¤”

I think that ESLint would have been so helpful while taking 111 and 211 because I struggled the most in those classes because of errors. It is also beneficial we didn't have ESLint then because it allowed us to understand the basics of programming too. Although I wish we had it then, I am grateful we didn't. It is just like taking any Math course in High School. I had a graphing calculator, but my teachers did not let us use them because it would make us lazy thinkers and have us rely just on technology to give us the answer. My friend who went to a different school said that their teachers prefered they use their calculators, but my friend said that she forgets how to do some basic math computations.
