For as long as I can remember, I have always been into puzzles. I started with jigsaw puzzles from when I was still in the babysitters, or so I'm told. When I was in Elementary, I saw I that Math and Science classes were easier for me over English and Social Studies. Soon after, I realized the reason those subjects came so easy to me is because I was an analytical thinker.

In High School, I took classes that allowed me to be able to use my strengths. My High School had pathways, i.e. Health, Business, Culinary and Hospitality, Agriculture, etc. I took part in the Business pathway, where I took Business Core, Office Administration, KeyBoarding, and Beginning and Advanced Accounting. All the way until my Senior year, I thought that I would major in Accounting in College.

It wasn't until one of my older sisters asked me if I had considered Computer Science as a major. She told me that a lot of her co-workers think just like me. At first, I thought that Computer Science was just for people who want to create games. After doing some research, I saw that Computer Science isn't just for games, but you could do other stuff with the major, such as IT, Analysts, etc. That was when I changed my mind, and decided to try something different.

I haven't really found something that I am truly passionate about, but I know that I get bored of things fast if they are not challenging enough. With Accounting, it was easy for me and I knew that I could be successful doing it, but it was boring. With Computer Science, I am constantly being challenged and I know that I will be challenged all the time because of how much technology is growing and new developments pop up.
