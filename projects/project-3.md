From the time I was 10 years old, I have been babysitting children. At first, it started out as just watching my sister's kids when they wanted to go out and relax for a night. After watching their kids for so long, their friends would ask if I could watch their kids. 

Once I turned 16 and got my license, the one night of babysitting, soon turned into babysitting for up to two weeks. Although I was on the younger side, I had to learn responsibility because I was no longer responsible for myself but for kids younger than me and that is a big responsibility.
