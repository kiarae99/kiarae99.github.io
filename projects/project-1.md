Pearl City High School has had a strong Air Rifle Team for many years. In the years 2013, 2014, and 2015, Pearl City qualified as the Number 1 seed from OIA. All 3 of those years, Pearl City High School's Girl's Air Rifle team was OIA Champions. 

I qualified as an Individual in 2014 and 2015, as well as for the team. In 2013 and 2015, my team was State Champions. 

High School Air Riflery is scored on the 3 positions, Prone, Standing, and Kneeling. Each position we have to shoot 20 targets, for a total of score of 600 points.
