Pearl City High is one of the underdog schools for Outrigger Paddling. A lot of the students there do not paddle because they are not as close to the water as most schools are. Prior to qualifying in 2016, Pearl City High School's Paddling team did not see the States race in over 2 years. 

In 2016, we had both the Varisty Boys and the Varsity Mix qualify. Although in 2017, all 3 teams were on the path to qualifying, both the Varsity Girls and the Varsity Boys team got disqualified in the OIA Championships. The Varsity Mix team was made up of 3 boys from the Varsity Boys team and 3 girls from the Varsity Girls team, all 6 of us were sad and mad that we got disqualified, but we put that distraction on the side and qualified as a Mix team. 

Both years, I was on the qualifying team. I raced in every seasoned race, as well as each round of States.
